Answers to explore section pt3 Questions:
1. I would use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because that's the point of the testing---you want to make sure that each part of the program works properly. In other word, we as the developer would try to avoid the situation where when the user write a message of "HeLLo WoRld", the software actually sends "hello world" because for whatever reason it only outputs lower-case.
2. I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of messaging application because there usually is a reason for setting this limit, therefore it is important to prevent it to exceed and cause additional problems. For example, if a buffer could only take 80 characters, then if for whatever reason the user is able to bypass the checking condition and send 81 character, it might causes security problem.
